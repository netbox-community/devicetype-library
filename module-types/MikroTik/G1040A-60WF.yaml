  Hot-swap power supply: replace the CCR2004, CRS510 or CRS504 power supply without
  having to turn off or even restart the router. Zero downtime!

  CCR2004-16G-2S+, CRS510-8XS-2XQ-IN+ and CRS504-4XQ-IN units come with two hot-swap
  dual redundant power supplies. If one of them goes out of order at some point, the
  other one will take over. Then you can use this kit to replace the old power supply
  and you don\'t even have to restart the router!
