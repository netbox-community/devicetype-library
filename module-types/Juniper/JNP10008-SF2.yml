  ## MX10008 Switch Fabric Board Description

  The SFBs make up the MX10008 switching plane. There are two models of SFBs: the JNP10008-SF and the JNP10008-SF2. Five SFBs are required for operation with the sixth providing N+1 redundancy. SFBs must all be of the same model type in a running chassis. On both models, the SFB has eight connectors on the connecter edge which match and connect to a connector on one of the eight line cards. See [Figure 1](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/hardware/mx10008/topics/topic-map/mx10008-16-switch-fabric.html#id-mx10008-switch-interface-board-description__d95e26).
