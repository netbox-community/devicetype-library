  ## MX10008 Routing and Control Board Description

  The MX10008 Routing and Control Board (RCB) is responsible for system management in an MX10008 router (see [Figure 1](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/hardware/mx10008/topics/topic-map/mx10008-16-rcb-description.html#id-mx10008-routing-and-control-board-description__d13e37)). The chassis can run with one or two RCBs. The base configuration ships with one RCB while a redundant configuration ships with two RCBs. When two RCBs are installed, one functions as the primary and the second as a backup. If the primary RCB is removed, the backup becomes the primary if graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES) is configured.

  MX10008 supports the following Routing Engines:

  - JNP10K-RE1
  - JNP10K-RE1-LT
  - JNP10K-RE1-128G
