manufacturer: Raspberry Pi
model: Compute Module 4008000
##
# Compute Module 4 comes in one of _many_ flavors
# RAM: 1/2/4/8 gig
# eMMC: 0/8/16/32 gig  (0 = "lite" version)
# Wireless: yes/no
# There are also extended temperatures versions, not included here as they're custom order for industrial use.
#
# The part number is in the format:
#     CM4WWRRFF where
#    WW = Wireless (00 = no, 10 = wifi)
#    RR = RAM (01 = 1 gig, 02 = 2 gig, 04 = 4 gig, 08 = 8 gig)
#    FF = Flash (00 = no flash, 08 = 8 gig, 16 = 16 gig, 32 = 32 gig)
# So a module with no flash, no wifi and 8 gig ram would be CM4008000
# As far as I can tell, the number does not change to account for the various PCB revisions.
