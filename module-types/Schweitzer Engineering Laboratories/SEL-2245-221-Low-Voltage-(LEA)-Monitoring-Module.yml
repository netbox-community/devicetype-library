manufacturer: Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories
model: SEL-2245-221 Low-Voltage (LEA) Monitoring Module
description: The SEL-2245-221 module provides four inputs for voltage or current monitoring applications. With four low-voltage input channels, this module
  can monitor a 0.05–22.0  Vrms ac voltage inputs or ±30 V peak dc voltage measurements. This module supports custom  per-channel calibration to monitor
  current measurement from external current transformers (e.g., split-core CT). In dc mode, it can also capture and record measurements from vital  components
  in the substation (e.g., trip coil currents during breaker operations).  Additionally, the module records waveform oscillography up to 24 kHz and generates  IEEE
  C37.118 synchrophasors.
