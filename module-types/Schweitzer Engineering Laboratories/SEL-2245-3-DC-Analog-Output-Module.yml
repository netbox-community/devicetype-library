manufacturer: Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories
model: SEL-2245-3 DC Analog Output Module
description: The SEL-2245-3 module includes eight software-selectable current or voltage outputs. The outputs are self-sourcing from –20 to +20 mA or –10
  to +10 V. This module supports a ramp feature for smooth transitions between set points and supports a clamp feature to prevent driving beyond a desired
  value. A total of two SEL-2245-3 modules can be installed in one SEL-2242 chassis and up to 16 modules in one Axion system. This module is ideal for proportional-integral-derivative
  (PID) output controls, analog meter displays, and analog set point delivery.
