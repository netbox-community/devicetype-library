manufacturer: Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories
model: SEL-2245-42 AC Protection Module
description: The SEL-2245-42 module includes three CTs with isolated returns and includes three PTs (or VTs) for measuring ac signals. This module has galvanically
  isolated inputs and can sample events at user software-selectable rates of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 kHz. Up to16 SEL-2245-42 modules can be used in one Axion
  system and feature synchronizedmeasurements throughout all modules. This enables time-deterministic control algorithms totake advantage of the common
  reference for all measurements, even those in distributedlocations. Collect IEEE C37.118.1a-2014-compliant synchrophasor data from up to 64 phasorquantities.
  Provide digital fault recording (DFR) capabilities with the Axion to recordand analyze power system dynamics and validate equipment performance.
