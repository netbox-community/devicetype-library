manufacturer: Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories
model: SEL-2245-411 Standard Current and Low-Voltage (LEA) Monitoring Module
description: The SEL-2245-411 module includes the same current inputs as the SEL-2245-4 AC Metering Module with four low-voltage inputs to support low-energy
  analog (LEA) voltage measurements. Deploy this module to monitor power system measurements using LEA voltage transducers. The module’s LEA channels measure
  0.05–22.0 Vrms ac voltage inputs. Additionally, the module records waveform oscillography up to 24 kHz and generates IEEE C37.118 synchrophasors.
