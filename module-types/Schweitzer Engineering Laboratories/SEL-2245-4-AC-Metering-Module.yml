manufacturer: Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories
model: SEL-2245-4 AC Metering Module
description: The SEL-2245-4 module includes four CT and four PT inputs with ranges of 0–22 A and 5–400 VL-N at a typical accuracy of 0.1 percent. Up to
  9 modules may be used in a node, and a maximum of 16 metering modules may be used in one Axion system, all with synchronized measurements for a common
  reference. Additionally, the module records waveform oscillography up to 24 kHz and generates IEEE C37.118 synchrophasors.
