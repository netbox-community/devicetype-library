comments: "[Datasheet](https://assets.tripplite.com/product-pdfs/en/b072032ip2.pdf)\n\nThe KVM features two RJ45 LAN ports for connecting to 10/100 Mbps\
  \ networks. If LAN 1 goes down, LAN 2 takes over. When LAN 1 becomes operational again, the KVM will need to be rebooted to make it the default LAN port\
  \ again. Note: Only one LAN port can be turned on at a time; they cannot both be turned on. If you don't wish to use network redundancy, connect a single\
  \ network cable to LAN 2 Port."
