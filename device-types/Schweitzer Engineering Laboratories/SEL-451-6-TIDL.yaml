comments: SEL Time-Domain Link (TiDL) technology is a protectioncentered digital secondary system solution engineered with simplicity in mind. This technology
  minimizes cybersecurity risks and network engineering by using point-to-point communications and a nonroutable protocol \ Communications Protocols - FTP,
  HTTP, TelNet, SEL ASCII, SEL Fast Message, Synchrophasors, DNP3, PRP, PTPv2, IEC 61850 v2 (optional) \
