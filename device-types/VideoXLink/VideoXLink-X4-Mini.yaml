  VideoXLink X4 Mini is the ultimate low latency production solution, suited for remote production usage
  in the field or being installed in a production studio, thanks to its 19" size and rack mount kit. By having
  4 3G-SDI bidirectional ports, the X4 Mini can be used as a flexible solution, turning inputs to outputs
  and vice versa. X4 Mini is also capable of encoding/decoding NDI, adding even more channels than
  the 4 SDI ports.

  X4 Mini is equipped with 4 ethernet interface cards, offering speeds between 1 Gbit/s to 10 Gbit/s and
  up to 25 Gbit/s with the optional 25 Gbit/s nic. All 4 ports are available for usage in the VideoXLink
  application, making it possible for using several backup connections, layer 2 trunks or high-speed
  connections to the local network when using NDI network streams.
