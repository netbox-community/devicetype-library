  VideoXLink X4 UHD is the ultimate low latency production solution, suited for remote production usage
  in the field or being installed in a production studio, thanks to its 19" size and rack mount kit. By having
  4 12G-SDI bidirectional ports, the X4 can be used as a flexible solution, turning inputs to outputs and
  vice versa. X4 is also capable of encoding/decoding NDI, adding even more channels than the 4 SDI.

  X4 is equipped with 4 ethernet interface cards, offering speeds between 1 Gbit/s to 10 Gbit/s and up to
  25 Gbit/s. All 4 ports are available for usage in the VideoXLink application, making it possible for using
  several backup connections, layer 2 trunks or high-speed connections to the local network when using
  NDI network streams.
